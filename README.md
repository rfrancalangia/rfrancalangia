- 👋 Hi, I’m @rfrancalangia
- 👀 I quit writing programs for pay and now I write programs in my free time
- 🌱 I’m currently working on web application help keep my trees alive
- 💞️ I'm not great with protecting environment variables so I have had to hide most of my current working repositories
- 📫 Once I figure that out I would like to contribute to open source communities
